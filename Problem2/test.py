# You need to write down your own code here 
# Task: Given any head entity name (e.g. Q30) and relation name (e.g. P6), you need to output the top 10 closest tail entity names.
# File entity2vec.vec and relation2vec.vec are 50-dimensional entity and relation embeddings.
# If you use the embeddings learned from Problem 1, you will get extra credits.
